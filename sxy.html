		<h1>the Story of Sheng Xiangyu</h1>
		<p><em>Introduction:
I am using WPS on Windows Subsystem of Linux and Xming. How great I am! But I could not type Chinese.  I do not want to fix it because I do not need to do that. You may not know what I mean, but that is what I want. You are terrible and your brain is like a monkey’s! By the way, I have an ancient story to share with you, about a successful monkey called Sheng Xiangyu.</em></p>
	<p>	Millions of hundreds of years ago, an ugly rock went down the top of a mountain, named Mt. Xinyuan by monkeys, and landed at the foot of Mount. Xinyuan. A monkey came up and take the rock in hand. Suddenly, the monkey threw out the rock and ran away from the foot of Mount. Xinyuan. The rock looked ugly, smelt terrible, and felt heavy. Because of the hate, monkeys named the rock Sheng Xiangyu which meant "The Ugliest Thing" in their langauge.</p>
	<p>	The monkeys built a fence to keep the terrible smelling away from their home. But it didn’t work, the situation became worse and worse for the monkeys, and as a result, the monkeys had no choice but to move their houses, food etc. to a very far place. Of course, they didn’t notice that the stone were changing years by years.</p>
	<p>	A monkey jumped out of Sheng Xiangyu. During the passing years, she was trying her best to break the stone. She looked around and found a sign on the stone suddenly. There were words on it. She read it out: <em>Sheng Xiangyu</em>. She thought the text on the sign was her name. So she called herself Sheng Xiangyu from then on.</p>
	<p>	Although she was a monkey, she couldn’t do what a normal monkey could do such as climbing up a tree. Her tail was short and no one could see it clearly without standing closer and closer. She looked like a human, but she had an ugly monkey face. But Sheng Xiangyu didn’t know that, because there was neither monkeys around her nor mirrors to see herself.</p>
